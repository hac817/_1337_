/*
 *You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job, you have to finish all
 *  the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).

* You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day
* of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done on that day.

* You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is jobDifficulty[i].

* Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
*
* Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
*
* Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
